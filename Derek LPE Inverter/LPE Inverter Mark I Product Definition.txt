LPE Inverter Mark 1 Definition


Introduction
A rudimentary one-directional inverter that contains a DC-DC converter, a DC-AC inverter, and an AC-AC step-up transformer to maintain a steady output with a variable input. The inverter shall report measured input battery voltage and output voltage to a wired device (a computer). The device shall be able to check the status and turn the inverter on/off.

Behavior Definition
Product States
    -Normal Operation
    -Push Power
    -Reduced Power
    -Low Voltage Cuttoff

Detailed Behavior
   Initial State: Normal Operation
        Inveter initially OFF
	Processor powered on by battery via regulator
	Device connected to processor via wire
	Device inputs an ON command
	Inverter is turned ON
	Processor constantly monitors input and output voltage
   
   State: Push Power
	Processor sees frequency (>-1 Hz) or voltage (> -1V) sag on output
	Processor directs inverter to push more power until frequency is >= 59.5 Hz or voltage is >= 11.75 V

   State: Reduce Power
	Processor sees frequency (>+1 Hz) or voltage (> +1V) rise on output
	Processor directs inverter to push more power until frequency is <= 60.5 Hz or voltage is <= 12.25 V

   State: Low Voltage Cutoff
	Processor sees battery voltage is < 9.6V
	Processor sends warning to device of low voltage every 3s
	All operation continue as previously instructed
	When voltage reaches 9V, Processor sends final warning 
	Processor turnsoff inverter
